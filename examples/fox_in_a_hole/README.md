# Fox in a Hole (Classical and Quantum version)

This game is based on the well known puzzle Fox in a Hole: There are 5 holes in a row, one of which occupied by the fox. Each day you can inspect one of the holes. Each night the fox moves to a neighboring hole. Find a strategy with which you can guaranteedly find the fox in finite days (e.g. in 10 days).

You can play the game in the classical way, as well as in the quantum way. 

## Rules of the classical version of the game
The fox starts in a random hole. The following repeats until the player finds the fox, exceeds 10 guesses or stops the game:
1.  The player can guess which hole the fox hides in. If the player guessed well, the player wins.
2.  The fox randomly moves one hole left or right. (On the sides, only one direction is possible.)

At the end of the game the program will print out for each day what the fox did and which hole the fox hid in.

## Rules of the quantum version of the game
The fox starts in a random hole. The following repeats until the player finds the fox, exceeds 10 guesses or stops the game:
1.  The player can guess which hole the fox hides in. This implies a measurement on that hole. If the fox is found to be in the guessed hole the player wins.
2.  The fox chooses a hole in which its existence has non-zero probability. For the chosen hole one of the following options is carried out randomly:
    * Moving left (provided the chosen hole is not the left-most one)
    * Moving right (provided the chosen hole is not the right-most one)
    * Moving left and right at the same time (provided the starting hole is not the left-most or right-most one)

At the end of the game, the program will print out for each day what the player's guess was, what the fox did, and which hole the fox hid in (with probability in case of the quantum version). 

# How to use the game

This is a command line game. After cloning the Unitary library, change the directory into `examples/fox_in_a_hole`. You can use command line flags to set up the game type:
  
```
usage: python fox_in_a_hole.py [-h] [-q] [-i] [-qprob p]

Fox-in-a-hole game.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  -q          Use quantum version instead of classical version.
  -i          Use iSWAP for moves in quantum case.
  -qprob p    Probability p of quantum move: 0.0<=p<=1.0. Default: 0.5.
