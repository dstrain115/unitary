    """An item is an object or person that can be interacted with.

    items have keywords that you can associate with them to
    interact with them, such as 'talk' for people, or press for
    button.

    Future functionality may allow these items to be picked up
    as well.

    Attributes:
        keyword_actions: Tuples of keywords and targets to actions.  A keyword
           is a single verb that can be used to interact with the item.
           An action is a string that is printed out, or a callable
           that will perform some sort of action.
        keyword_targets:  Optional list of targets.  For instance,
           ['Erwin', 'physicist'] would match 'talk Erwin' or
           'talk physicist'. If this is blank, the item will
           intercept all commands with the keyword_actions.
        description: Optional string that will be printed out as
           part of the room description.
